I first dove into Python in early 2023 - about six months into my coding journey in school - and quickly got the itch to build something useful outside of school. After trying out a bunch of modmail tools that felt outdated, clunky, or just too locked-down, I figured, \"Why not make my own?\"\nAs a Discord server admin, I needed something flexible and easy to customize, so I designed SupportMail to be exactly that: lightweight, reliable, and ready to go in minutes. Since then, I’ve fallen in love with building better server-management tools (and I’ve even whipped up a few other handy utilities along the way).\nMy mission hasn’t changed: I’m here to make support effortless for everyone. That’s why I lean on our community’s feedback and suggestions - to keep improving the bot every day. I want SupportMail to be more than just a tool; I want it to be a genuine asset for both server administrators and members. If you have ideas or feedback, please share them in our [Discord server](https://help.supportmail.dev/).\nIn short, my goal is simple: streamline support for communities of any size. Thank you for trying SupportMail - let’s keep building something great, together!",
